## Introduction

This research explores the relationship between household travel behavior and voter preferences for climate-related taxes in Washington State. We examine how variations in travel patterns might influence public support for specific climate change change-related taxation policies. The analysis builds a harmonized, census tract-scale data set and uses several statistical models to explore the relationship between these variables.

## Data and Methods

### Data Opertionalization

-   **Travel Behavior:** Represented by average daily vehicle miles travele (VMT) per household, sourced from the US Department of Transportation's Local Characteristics for Households [dataset](https://www.bts.gov/latch/latch-data). This metric reflects household mobility patterns.
-   **Voter Preferences for Climate-Related Taxes:** Quantified through the results of the Initiative 732 vote in 2016, which proposed a carbon tax aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This serves as a direct measure of voter support for climate-related taxation.
-   **Political Partisanship:** Operationalized using the 2016 presidential election voting results, indicating the political values of voters, which may influence their support for environment- and/or taxation-related policy.

### Model Descriptions

#### Univariate Linear Model

The univariate Ordinary Least Squares linear model examines the direct relationship between voter support for the climate-related tax and household travel behavior. This model is articulated through the following linear equation:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \epsilon_i
$$

In this equation:

-   $y_i$ represents the response variable, specifically the share of 'No' votes on Initiative 732.
-   $\beta_0$ is the y-axis intercept, indicating the baseline level of opposition to the initiative when average daily VMT per household is zero.
-   $\beta_1x_{1i}$ is the coefficient for the explanatory variable, average daily VMT per household, which quantifies the change in the proportion of 'No' votes as VMT varies.
-   $\epsilon_i$ denotes the random error term, accounting for the variation in 'No' votes not explained by travel behavior.

Here, $y_i$ represents the response variable (share of 'No' votes on Initiative 732), $\beta_0$ is the model's y-axis intercept, $\beta_1x_{1i}$ is the coefficient of the explanatory variable (average daily VMT per household), and $\epsilon_i$ represents the random error term.

This model establishes a baseline for identifying potential correlations between travel behavior and voter preferences regarding climate-related taxes, without considering any other confounding factors. It provides a straightforward way to assess the primary effect of travel on voting behavior before introducing more complexity into the analysis.

#### Multivariate Linear Model

Expanding upon the univariate linear model, the multivariate linear model incorporates an additional explanatory variable: political partisanship. This model is specified through the following equation:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \epsilon_i
$$

In this equation, $\beta_2x_{2i}$ is the coefficient of the additional explanatory variable (share of votes for the Republican presidential candidate).

This model evaluates how both travel behavior and political orientation together affect support for climate-related taxes.

#### Spatial Lag Model

The Spatial Lag Model refines the multivariate Extended Linear Model by including a spatial lag variable that accounts for "spillover effect" (i.e., spatial autocorrelation of model residuals) of the multivariate linear model's dependent variable.

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1i} + \beta_2x_{2i} + \rho w \cdot y_i + \epsilon_i
$$

In this equation:

-   $\rho$ is the spatial-autoregressive coefficient
-   $w$ is a spatial weights matrix

Each model progressively incorporates more complexity to address different hypotheses about the influences on voter preferences regarding climate policy in Washington State. This approach allows for a nuanced analysis, distinguishing direct effects from those mediated by political identity or spatial proximity.
